This is a test file for keyword searching.
The program should find this line because it contains the keyword apple.
This line has nothing special.
Here's another line with the keyword apple in it.
Keywords are case sensitive, so APPLE won't match the keyword.
This is the last line of the test file.
Let's make this the last line of the output file: apple.
